### Usage:

Clone the repo somewhere, cd in and:

`./cowsh`

Or, just copy-paste `cowsh` into a new file:

`bash <name of file>`

### Warnings

Cowshell appends a line to the `~/.bash_profile` of whoever runs it.  Cowshell
copies their original `~/.bash_profile` before doing so.  I am not responsible
for anything this script does to anyone.

### Spoilers

`kill -9` is your friend.
